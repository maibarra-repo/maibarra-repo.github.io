# About Me

## My Hobbies

 I like to read stories that involve many different genres such as:
 * [Urban fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_fantasy)
 * [Sword and Sorcery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sorcery)
 * [Superhero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_fiction)

 I also like to watch video adaptations of the stories I read.

## Interesting websites
* [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/home)  
 I find Royal Road an amazing place to discover new stories that have yet to be published into books.
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)  
 Youtube is an amazing website to find videos about any book series that I might be interested in knowing more about.
